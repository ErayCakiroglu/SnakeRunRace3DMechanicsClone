TODO List:
-Create a snake controller script. AI controller and Player Controller must use that script to control the snake.
-Use LeanTouch for input
-Create more realistic snake body with Spline package
-AI must use deterministic movement instead of navmesh agent. Spline follower can be used to describe snaked movement.
-Project is inside sub folder of the repository. Move it to the root folder.
-Crate independent UI scripts. Use events or actions to communicate with other scripts.
